# BlazorRades
Azure Portal Blades type functionality

Created a separate project for the Client side and the web host, "BlazorRades-Client" it still uses the BlazorRades component but it was so different from server side it made sense to create something new. Perhaps later it will become apparent what the similarities are.

The solution is the BlazorRadesWeb\BlazorRadesWeb.sln
